# fund-vis-v2
App to (eventually) track the Tanki Fund, better remake of github.com/evesdropper/fund-vis. Made with Pandas, Plotly (Dash), deployed on TBD.

Will not be used in the upcoming Tanki Fund due to time constraints.

## Goals
- Create a more reliable fund tracker (should work regardless of computer status).
- Provide better quality visualizations and more working models.
- Provide better UI/UX (use more web design, interactive plots with Plotly).

Due to the nature of said goals and increased time constraints due to real life commitments, the fund visualizer will take longer to create, hence why it is not going to be fully working until much later. However, there will be some small tests that may be live from time to time, so stay tuned.
